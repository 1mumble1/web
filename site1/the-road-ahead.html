      Dark spruce forest frowned on either side the frozen waterway. 
      The trees had been stripped by a recent wind of their white 
      covering of frost, and they seemed to lean towards each other, 
      black and ominous, in the fading light. A vast silence reigned 
      over the land. The land itself was a desolation, lifeless, 
      without movement, so lone and cold that the spirit of it was 
      not even that of sadness. There was a hint in it of laughter, 
      but of a laughter more terrible than any sadness—a laughter 
      that was mirthless as the smile of the sphinx, a laughter cold 
      as the frost and partaking of the grimness of infallibility. 
      It was the masterful and incommunicable wisdom of eternity 
      laughing at the futility of life and the effort of life. 
      It was the Wild, the savage, frozen-hearted Northland Wild.
    </p>
    <p class="main__text">
      But there was life, abroad in the land and defiant. Down the frozen 
      waterway toiled a string of wolfish dogs. Their bristly fur was rimed 
      with frost. Their breath froze in the air as it left their mouths, 
      spouting forth in spumes of vapour that settled upon the hair of their 
      bodies and formed into crystals of frost. Leather harness was on the 
      dogs, and leather traces attached them to a sled which dragged along 
      behind. The sled was without runners. It was made of stout birch-bark, 
      and its full surface rested on the snow. The front end of the sled 
      was turned up, like a scroll, in order to force down and under the 
      bore of soft snow that surged like a wave before it. On the sled, 
      securely lashed, was a long and narrow oblong box. There were other 
      things on the sled—blankets, an axe, and a coffee-pot and frying-pan; 
      but prominent, occupying most of the space, was the long and narrow oblong box.
    </p>
    <p class="main__text">
      In advance of the dogs, on wide snowshoes, toiled a man. 
      At the rear of the sled toiled a second man. On the sled, 
      in the box, lay a third man whose toil was over,—a man whom 
      the Wild had conquered and beaten down until he would never 
      move nor struggle again. It is not the way of the Wild to 
      like movement. Life is an offence to it, for life is movement; 
      and the Wild aims always to destroy movement. It freezes the water 
      to prevent it running to the sea; it drives the sap out of 
      the trees till they are frozen to their mighty hearts; and most 
      ferociously and terribly of all does the Wild harry and crush into 
      submission man—man who is the most restless of life, ever in revolt against 
      the dictum that all movement must in the end come to the cessation of movement.

      But at front and rear, unawed and indomitable, toiled the two men who 
      were not yet dead. Their bodies were covered with fur and soft-tanned leather. 
      Eyelashes and cheeks and lips were so coated with the crystals from 
      their frozen breath that their faces were not discernible. 
      This gave them the seeming of ghostly masques, undertakers in a spectral 
      world at the funeral of some ghost. But under it all they were men, 
      penetrating the land of desolation and mockery and silence, puny adventurers 
      bent on colossal adventure, pitting themselves against the might of a world 
      as remote and alien and pulseless as the abysses of space.
